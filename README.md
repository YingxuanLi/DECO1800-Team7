# DECO1800-Team7
Project for an interactive wildlife-themed website

# Purpose & Motivation
The purpose of this website to teach children about animals in Australia, specifically ones from queensland. Animals are very important inhabitants in this shared world. By sparking curiosity in Children, we wanted them to have compassaion and empathy towards other inhabitants on this planet earth.


## Pitch 
Wildlife guide junior is an interactive and engaging platform for young students to learn about the wildlife here in Queensland. Students can learn about specific information about animals such as their endemicity and scientific names, this information is queried from API as per course requirement. We also provided an interactive map so students can see the distribution of a specific animal species. Last but not least, we included a video page so students can learn about animals through short videos. 




## API queries:
* Specific animal information are queried from Queensland WildNet API
* location information (animal sightings) are queried from Atals of Living Australia (these information are projected onto the map).
* Specie image is retrieved from Wikipedia API.

## Server side language jsutification:
PHP is used to dynamically generate content from queried information. If we were to used HTML to build a static website, there would be over 200 static pages. 



## Deisign considerations?

## why use these interactions ?

## why php over javascript ?

## how do you justify using server side language over client side language



Implementation: API data from QLDWildenet, quiz/game, educative videos, Teacher mode
